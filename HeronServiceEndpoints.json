Orthoimagery data are typically high resolution aerial images that combine the visual attributes of an aerial photograph with the spatial accuracy and reliability of a planimetric map. USGS digital orthoimage resolution may vary from 6 inches to 1 meter. In the former resolution, every pixel in an orthoimage covers a six inch square of the earth's surface, while in the latter resolution, one meter square is represented by each pixel. Blue Marble: Next Generation and Landsat imagery data sources are displayed at small to medium scales, however, the majority of the imagery service source is from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) for the conterminous United States. The data is 1 meter pixel resolution collected with 'leaf-on' conditions. Collection of NAIP imagery is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency (FSA). In areas where NAIP data is not available, other imagery may be acquired through partnerships by the USGS. For Alaska, 10-meter resolution SPOT imagery is provided for viewing. The National Map download client allows free downloads of public domain, 1-meter resolution orthoimagery in JPEG 2000 (jp2) format for the conterminous United States. However, the 10-meter Alaska orthoimagery data will not be available for direct download from the National Map due to license restrictions.
